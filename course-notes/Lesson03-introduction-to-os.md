# Introduction To Operating Systems

## What is an operating system

The OS:

* is a software that "sits" between the computer hardware and the software applications.
* has privileged access to the underlying hardware
* hides the complexity of the hardware system and instead provides abstractions for interacting with the hardware devices.
* manages the hardware resources on behalf of the applications according to some predefined polices.
* schedules tasks to the CPU
* manages memory
* provides isolation and protection for running applications from one another
